Dear __member__,

Thanks for voting. Your vote has been registered with the following checksum:

__checksum__

You can use that checksum to verify your vote once the voting period has
finished.

More details about recording votes here:

Remember that you can still change your vote while the voting period is running.
In such case the checksum and random key will also change.

Thanks for your participation,
Boriss and the Elections Team.
